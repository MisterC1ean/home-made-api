I still remember the first time I picked up a copy of The Hobbit in my elementary school library as a fifth-grader, and how many of my teachers and older family members told me I was in for a real treat. One of the most beloved characters in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is Gandalf the Grey, later Gandalf the White -- although \"many are his names in many countries.\" When Tolkien first mentions Gandalf in the first chapter of The Hobbit, he describes Gandalf this way: \"All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.\" ...So a little different from how the wonderful Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in the films. Both versions, in my opinion, are completely valid, however. Tolkien's inspiration for Gandalf can be traced to a postcard he said he bought while on holiday in Switzerland (although the origins of the postcard have been debated). The postcard is called Der Berggeist (German for \"the mountain spirit\"). The postcard was a reproduction of a painting of an old man with a white beard sitting under a tree in the mountains. On the back of the postcard, Tolkien wrote \"The origin of Gandalf.\" So with all that being said, if you can get ahold of some blue-grey felt, as opposed to the dark grey felt I used, that would be more true to the books as well as Tolkien's original vision of Gandalf. But I think a medium-dark grey felt works just fine. Okay, let's get started!

I still remember the first time I picked up a copy of The Hobbit in my elementary school library as a fifth-grader, and how many of my teachers and older family members told me I was in for a real treat. One of the most beloved characters in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is Gandalf the Grey, later Gandalf the White -- although \"many are his names in many countries.\" When Tolkien first mentions Gandalf in the first chapter of The Hobbit, he describes Gandalf this way: \"All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.\" ...So a little different from how the wonderful Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in the films. Both versions, in my opinion, are completely valid, however. Tolkien's inspiration for Gandalf can be traced to a postcard he said he bought while on holiday in Switzerland (although the origins of the postcard have been debated). The postcard is called Der Berggeist (German for \"the mountain spirit\"). The postcard was a reproduction of a painting of an old man with a white beard sitting under a tree in the mountains. On the back of the postcard, Tolkien wrote \"The origin of Gandalf.\" So with all that being said, if you can get ahold of some blue-grey felt, as opposed to the dark grey felt I used, that would be more true to the books as well as Tolkien's original vision of Gandalf. But I think a medium-dark grey felt works just fine. Okay, let's get started!

I still remember the first time I picked up a copy of The Hobbit in my elementary school library as a fifth-grader, and how many of my teachers and older family members told me I was in for a real treat. One of the most beloved characters in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is Gandalf the Grey, later Gandalf the White -- although \"many are his names in many countries.\" When Tolkien first mentions Gandalf in the first chapter of The Hobbit, he describes Gandalf this way: \"All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.\" ...So a little different from how the wonderful Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in the films. Both versions, in my opinion, are completely valid, however. Tolkien's inspiration for Gandalf can be traced to a postcard he said he bought while on holiday in Switzerland (although the origins of the postcard have been debated). The postcard is called Der Berggeist (German for \"the mountain spirit\"). The postcard was a reproduction of a painting of an old man with a white beard sitting under a tree in the mountains. On the back of the postcard, Tolkien wrote \"The origin of Gandalf.\" So with all that being said, if you can get ahold of some blue-grey felt, as opposed to the dark grey felt I used, that would be more true to the books as well as Tolkien's original vision of Gandalf. But I think a medium-dark grey felt works just fine. Okay, let's get started!

I still remember the first time I picked up a copy of The Hobbit in my elementary school library as a fifth-grader, and how many of my teachers and older family members told me I was in for a real treat. One of the most beloved characters in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is Gandalf the Grey, later Gandalf the White -- although \"many are his names in many countries.\" When Tolkien first mentions Gandalf in the first chapter of The Hobbit, he describes Gandalf this way: \"All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.\" ...So a little different from how the wonderful Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in the films. Both versions, in my opinion, are completely valid, however. Tolkien's inspiration for Gandalf can be traced to a postcard he said he bought while on holiday in Switzerland (although the origins of the postcard have been debated). The postcard is called Der Berggeist (German for \"the mountain spirit\"). The postcard was a reproduction of a painting of an old man with a white beard sitting under a tree in the mountains. On the back of the postcard, Tolkien wrote \"The origin of Gandalf.\" So with all that being said, if you can get ahold of some blue-grey felt, as opposed to the dark grey felt I used, that would be more true to the books as well as Tolkien's original vision of Gandalf. But I think a medium-dark grey felt works just fine. Okay, let's get started!

I still remember the first time I picked up a copy of The Hobbit in my elementary school library as a fifth-grader, and how many of my teachers and older family members told me I was in for a real treat. One of the most beloved characters in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is Gandalf the Grey, later Gandalf the White -- although \"many are his names in many countries.\" When Tolkien first mentions Gandalf in the first chapter of The Hobbit, he describes Gandalf this way: \"All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.\" ...So a little different from how the wonderful Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in the films. Both versions, in my opinion, are completely valid, however. Tolkien's inspiration for Gandalf can be traced to a postcard he said he bought while on holiday in Switzerland (although the origins of the postcard have been debated). The postcard is called Der Berggeist (German for \"the mountain spirit\"). The postcard was a reproduction of a painting of an old man with a white beard sitting under a tree in the mountains. On the back of the postcard, Tolkien wrote \"The origin of Gandalf.\" So with all that being said, if you can get ahold of some blue-grey felt, as opposed to the dark grey felt I used, that would be more true to the books as well as Tolkien's original vision of Gandalf. But I think a medium-dark grey felt works just fine. Okay, let's get started!

I still remember the first time I picked up a copy of The Hobbit in my elementary school library as a fifth-grader, and how many of my teachers and older family members told me I was in for a real treat. One of the most beloved characters in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is Gandalf the Grey, later Gandalf the White -- although \"many are his names in many countries.\" When Tolkien first mentions Gandalf in the first chapter of The Hobbit, he describes Gandalf this way: \"All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.\" ...So a little different from how the wonderful Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in the films. Both versions, in my opinion, are completely valid, however. Tolkien's inspiration for Gandalf can be traced to a postcard he said he bought while on holiday in Switzerland (although the origins of the postcard have been debated). The postcard is called Der Berggeist (German for \"the mountain spirit\"). The postcard was a reproduction of a painting of an old man with a white beard sitting under a tree in the mountains. On the back of the postcard, Tolkien wrote \"The origin of Gandalf.\" So with all that being said, if you can get ahold of some blue-grey felt, as opposed to the dark grey felt I used, that would be more true to the books as well as Tolkien's original vision of Gandalf. But I think a medium-dark grey felt works just fine. Okay, let's get started!

To do this, we will be drilling two holes, one for the antenna, and one for the button.  I started with the antenna hole. First, I placed the antenna board inside the tin can, to measure how far from the side the hole would need to be. Then, using my finger to note the ridge, I marked the hole with an Whiteboard marker, so that I could wipe them off later. Then, using a tap, I put a small indentation where I was going to drill. This will help guide the drill in the next step.   Depending on the antenna you use, you may need a smaller/larger hole. So what I did to find the right size, was compared the threads on the antenna to the drill bit sizes. Alright, SAFETY GLASSES ON!  Once you’ve picked a size and marked out the hole, drill into the can, go at a high speed, but don’t push too hard. Because of how flimsy the tin can is, it will usually shear, so watch for sharp metal. Use tins nips and pliers to clean up this edge.   Then it’s time for the button hole. This one’s a little different.   First, I unscrewed the plastic “nut” from the button. Then I placed the nut onto the location I wanted the hole, and marked the inside diameter. Then I drilled five holes, and used tin snips to clean the material out and form it into a circle. Mark the hole, tap it, and drill.  STOP! It's HAMMERTIME! After this, I used a hammer and pliers to knock in the metal tabs and bend them down.  Please refer to the images for a better idea of how I did this. I’ve provided a shoddy diagram that should be able to help you out.   Once that’s done, you can screw in the antenna and the button.
